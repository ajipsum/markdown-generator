# MdSerializationOptions.MaxLineLength Property

**Declaring Type:** [MdSerializationOptions](../index.md)

Gets or sets the maximum length of a line in the output. When set to a value greater than 0, line breaks will be inserted after the specified number of characters when possible.

Default value: `-1` (no line length limitation)

```csharp
public int MaxLineLength { get; set; }
```

## Property Value

int

## Remarks

Not all types of blocks can be split into multiple lines. Also line breaks will only be inserted between words, so if the length of a word exceeds the maximum line length the max length cannot be adhered to
