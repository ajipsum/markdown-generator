# MdHeading.Anchor Property

**Declaring Type:** [MdHeading](../index.md)

Gets the HTML anchor for this heading.

```csharp
public string Anchor { get; }
```

## Property Value

string

## Remarks

The HTML anchor can be used for linking to a heading within a page. It is automatically derived from the heading text by removing all punctuation, replacing spaces with dashes and converting the text to lower case.

Note: Text anchors are not part of the CommonMark spec so linking to this anchor might not work in  every markdown implementation.

The anchor does not include the leading '\#' required for links.
